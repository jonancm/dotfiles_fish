## Features

- Install {fish} and link {fish} configuration files (directories `conf.d` and `functions`)
- Install {fisher} and selected plugins (see link:fish_plugins[])
- Install selected {nerd-fonts}
- Replace `ls` with {lsd}

## System requirements

Different distributions and releases ship with different fish versions.

The biggest source of problems is the compatibility between {fish} and {tide}
(see {fish-tide-compatibility})

To guarantee compatibility with the least possible maintenance effort,
the latest {fish} version required, and the {fisher} plugins have been fixed
to the specific versions known to work with the current {fish} version.

Therefore, only the following combinations are supported:
